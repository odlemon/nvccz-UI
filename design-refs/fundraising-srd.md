Every opportunity must be attached to:

# Audit Log

Every material action generates an immutable audit record.

- User
- Role
- IP Address
- Session ID
- Device
- Action
- Object
- Previous Value
- New Value
- Reason

Audit logs cannot be edited or deleted.

# Developer Guardrails

Developers must ensure the following rules are never violated:

- Signed documents do not automatically mean a deal is won.
- Signed commitments are not cash received.
- Awarded mandates are not activated AUM.
- Drag-and-drop never bypasses validation.
- Investor organisations are never duplicated.
- Internal notes are never exposed externally.
- Historical amounts and stages are immutable.

The completed platform must satisfy the following:

- Support Asset Management, Private Equity, and Venture Capital fundraising workflows.

# Final Product Vision

The completed ARCUS Fundraising, Investor Relations & Mandate Origination System is an institutional-grade fundraising and mandate origination platform built for asset managers, private equity firms, and venture capital funds.

The platform combines fundraising CRM, investor relationship management, due diligence, secure document sharing, electronic signatures, commitments, mandate onboarding, forecasting, analytics, compliance, and reporting into a unified workflow while maintaining strict separation between commercial, legal, compliance, accounting, and operational states.
